*By Chance Smith*

Before I started software development classes with Flatiron, I actually took an into to web design class in highschool. We started off with learning very basic html and I was quickly hooked! I was fascinated by the ways you could manipulate elements on a webpage that I built myself! I remember having the craving to figure out what else I could learn about coding, and how much of my own creativity I could put into a webpage. We also took a field trip to a local web development company called Madwire. When i saw all of the teams working together to make these amazing looking websites, I thought to myself that this would be something I could do. But when I went to college I decided to go for Psychology and for some reason didn't think about going for coding. I think that the words "software development" scared me off for the time, but after talking with a friend in the field and some family friends, I decided to give it a shot! I kept hearing about people that would be in another country, at a resort, by the pool writing code. If that doesn't sound like a dream job then I don't know what does! Having the freedom to express creativity and be able to work from anywhere sounded like a perfect fit for what I want to end up doing. So with that I got enrolled with Flatiron Schools and started my coding adventure!
