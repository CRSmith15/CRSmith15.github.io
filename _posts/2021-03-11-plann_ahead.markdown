For my final project I decided to make an app that I would personally like to use and impliment more of into my life. A Planner app! I have a difficulty managing my time, so wanted to make an app that I could use to help keep track of things that I needed to get done. 

Creating this app presented a lot of challenges, but I was ready to take them on! For me the biggest challenge was trying to think with React and Redux. I had gotten comfortable working with javascript, but once I saw everything that React had to offer, I was both indimdated and excited. There were so many things that seemed kinda daunting at first, like props, state and store. Though the more I worked with them, the more I started to see the versitility of using this framework. It felt as if having some of these things would cut down on repetitive code and be more user friendly once you got comfortable with it!

For me, the biggest challenge for this project was connecting up my front end with my backend and making sure that everything was updated and returned correctly. I kept on trying to use some variables that I thought were already defined, but turns out I was just using them incorrectly. I really like that when making calls to my backend in my reducer, I could also update the entire store and keep everything mostly the same. It really helped with my thought process while creating my app and I felt like it helped my app flow nicely!
