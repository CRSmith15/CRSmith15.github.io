For my second project I wanted to make an app where people could come together and share their experiences with certain video games that they have played. I always enjoy seeing what other people thought about certain games and if I were in the shoes of the developers of the games, I would want to see what people were saying about my games. Maybe some people would have some good advice or ideas that would be a valuable addition the the game! Making this was challenging, but honestly it was a lot of fun to see my work coming together in the form of an app!

This being my first sinatra project I was a little indtimidated at first with all of the things I would have to implement and get to work together. Though as I progressed further and further through the project I became a lot more comfortable from making this web app from scratch. I even started to think about all of the possibilities that I could add to my app, but not wanting to bite off more than I could chew, I decided to keep it fairly simple. I wanted more to increase my ablilty to create a solid functional app instead of spending time trying to add features that my app would not benefit much from. I am glad I decided that, because all of the things that I needed to get to work together was a little unwieldy at first. Once I got the basic relations down I felt like I could mess around with some more fun things, like displaying error and welcome messages properly and adding some styling to my project!

Overall I had a lot of fun with this build and I am very proud of the results. I remember starting out, only knowing some very basic HTML and now I am able to build out a functional application. It may not be the prettiest one out there (I am not a designer for a reason), but it's mine and I am very happy with the way it turned out! Seeing all of the possible ways to approach things seems crazy to me, but at the same time, it makes sense and is also very intriguing. Coding feels like a massive puzzle that has multipul different pieces that can fit in a lot of different spots. I was never big into puzzles, but writing code and creating something from nothing has been a very rewarding experience and I cannot wait to see what the future holds!
