It has been a long and hard journey through this course for me. There were many time where I would be frustrated and want to just give up, because I couldn't figure some things out and would get overwhelmed when looking up ways to fix my issues. It felt like a giant sea of information of which I only understood a tiny portion of. I still feel this way, but now it is more so excting! There are so many different ways to approach everything, and so many possibilities out there to create something interesting! 

Being at Flatiron has been amazing. Everyone that I would reach out to for help, went above and beyond to make sure I got what I needed. If it wasn't for them I probably would have given up! But they showed me that there is always a way to fix things, and more often than not, there were many ways to fix things! 

I remember starting to learn basic Ruby and I was so excited! Getting things down was such an amazing feeling, and I honestly thought everything was gonna build off of that. Things didn't exactly turn out that way. Even up until the very end I was using Ruby in my apps, so I am very glad we spend as much time as we did getting Ruby down. I felt like it taught me a lot of basic coding fundamentals. The way the code executes, the ways you can manipulate and change data, and getting different parts of an app communicating with eachother is so cool to me! I cannot wait for the future and all of the amazing things I will get to learn and expand on! Thank you to everybody at Flatiron! You guys are the best!
