For my third project, using ruby on rails I created a Game Pitcher app where people could share their ideas for new video games! Being a gamer, I see a lot of cool things games do, and a lot of bad choices developers/companies make. After playing and talking with others about games, I noticed that sometimes we would come up with some really cool ideas for games. The creation of this app stemed from that idea. I wanted a place to just throw out ideas to a comunity and see what their reactions would be. This turned out to be very difficult in some spots when coding, but ended up cementing a lot of ideas and problem solving tacits. 

I remember when the "Pry" gem was first introduced. At first I thought I kind of undstood how it could help, but until working on this project, I never realized how much potential it had to help with debugging and just testing out things in my code. Whenever I would create a new method, I would pretty much always use pry to just play around with the code and just test to see that things were working properly.

I would say the biggest challenge for me durring this project build was making sure all of my links would work and actually send you to the right place. I had many links that would just send you back to the exact same page or a completely unrelated page or would just plain old not work at all. It became kind of frustrating, but staying calm or taking a little break would always help me refoucs and dial everything back in. I remember getting all of the links sending you to the right place and I was ecstatic!

This whole project really helped me with my routes and links by ten fold. Coming into it, I felt as if I only had a basic understanding, which I probably only still have, but I am a lot more comfortable with them now am able to take that and transfer that knowledge into future projects! Playing around with my code always felt like a good way to get a better understading on how things work together in tandum, debug certain methods, or just experiment with possible things that I could add to this or future builds!
