For my fourth project I made a single page app where you can play the card game War against a dealer. I always played the card game War with friends and family when I was younger and I thought it would be a great project using JavaScript! I had a lot of fun getting it to work, but also ran into a lot of challenges. My biggest challenges were getting the cards right and rendering the correct things to the user, like the rules and their match history.

When trying to render things like match history and the rules, I kept on rendering mulitpul coppies of everything and it just did not look right. Also making sure that the right scores were posted to the match history container was very frustrating at the start, but eventually I was able to render the correct scores in the correct order and continuously update them whenever the game would finish. What a relief! 

Next came making sure the css would keep everything were it needed to be, even when the size of the window would change. It was very challenging to find the right combonation in my css to keep everyting looking clean and orderly. Also trying to keep my nav bar going the entire length of the page was difficult at first, but setting its height to the entire view window ended up doing the trick!

For me this project really helped with my css skills, while also helping me get a lot more familiar with setting up a javascript application from scratch! I cannot wait to take these skills that I have learned from this project and use them in future apps with a lot more efficiency!
